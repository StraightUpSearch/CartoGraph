# CartoGraph — Soul Document

> Why we exist, who we serve, and what winning looks like.

## Mission

Make the UK ecommerce landscape legible.

We give businesses the intelligence to find buyers, not browsers — by continuously mapping every ecommerce domain in the UK against commercial search intent signals, and making that intelligence instantly queryable.

---

## The problem we solve

The UK ecommerce market is worth £127.4 billion per year. There are approximately 1.07 million ecommerce-enabled websites. No dedicated UK ecommerce domain intelligence platform exists.

Global tools (Store Leads, BuiltWith, SimilarWeb) operate with global breadth and shallow UK depth. They tell you a domain uses Shopify. They do not tell you whether it ranks for commercial buying terms, which SERP features it appears in, whether its traffic is growing, or what its intent profile looks like.

The result: agencies waste time prospecting dead leads. SaaS vendors send cold outreach to stores with no budget. Link builders buy lists that are 40% irrelevant. PE firms make acquisition decisions without current data.

CartoGraph exists to close that gap.

## Positioning statement

The only continuously updated UK database of ecommerce domains validated through commercial search intent analysis. Every domain is verified by SERP presence for transactional, commercial investigation, and price-sensitive queries — segmented by SERP features (Shopping carousel, PAA, AI Overview, Featured Snippet) — with compounding enrichment and change tracking built in.

Unlike Store Leads (Shopify-centric, global breadth, $75+/mo) or BuiltWith (technology-only, $295+/mo), CartoGraph combines technology detection, SEO metrics, SERP feature intelligence, and commercial intent scores into one product built specifically for the UK market.

## Competitive moat

| Moat layer | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Intent validation** | Every domain verified via SERP presence for commercial keyword patterns. BuiltWith and Store Leads do not do this. |
| **UK depth over global breadth** | Deeper enrichment per UK domain than any global tool. First-mover in this niche. |
| **Compound enrichment** | Seven-agent pipeline creates layered intelligence no single API provides. Integration complexity deters casual competitors. |
| **SERP feature intelligence** | Tracks which domains appear in Shopping carousels, PAA, AI Overviews — a proprietary dataset from continuous SERP monitoring. |
| **Freshness moat** | Scheduled deltas and replayable snapshots, not one-off exports. Operational execution requirement that compounds over time. |
| **Compliance moat** | Minimise personal data, store signals not scraped address books. Reduces legal risk vs competitors who scrape freely. |

## Monetisation hooks (use these in UI copy)

| Hook | Where it appears |
|------|-----------------|
| "Find buyers, not browsers" | Homepage hero, filter panel header |
| "Catch winners early" | Trending deltas tab |
| "Export outreach-ready lists" | Export gate modal |
| "See who outranks you on buying terms" | Competitor comparison view |
| "Repeatable market maps for clients" | Agency tier landing page |

## What we will NOT build (scope guard)

- **A global database.** We go deep on UK first. US expansion only after UK MRR exceeds £25K and 70%+ month-6 cohort retention.
- **A link building tool.** We surface link prospects; we don't run outreach campaigns.
- **An SEO rank tracker.** We use SERP data to discover and classify domains; we don't position ourselves as a rank tracker.
- **A personal data harvester.** No personal email scraping. No bulk contact databases. GDPR-first by design.
- **A browser extension.** Distribution strategy is direct SaaS, not extension-first.
- **A backlink checker.** We consume Moz/DataForSEO for authority metrics; we don't compete with them.

## What winning looks like

**Month 3:** 50 paying customers, £2,500 MRR, Founding Member programme live.
**Month 6:** 150 paying customers, £7,500 MRR, data quality validated by users.
**Month 12:** 500 paying customers, £32,000 MRR, first Enterprise deals closed.
**Year 2:** UK full coverage (1M+ domains), US market entered, £100K+ MRR.

The compound value flywheel: more domains → better intent benchmarks → more useful filters → more conversions → more revenue → more data capacity → more domains.

## Culture and operating principles

1. **Evidence over assertion.** Every confidence score needs an evidence array. Every product decision needs data.
2. **UK-first depth.** We resist the temptation to go broad. Better to own one market deeply.
3. **Compliance by design.** GDPR is not a checkbox. It is a feature and a competitive moat.
4. **Ship, then iterate.** MVP with 10K validated UK domains beats a perfect product that launches in 18 months.
5. **Provider abstraction always.** Never hard-code a single data source. Every external dependency sits behind an interface.
